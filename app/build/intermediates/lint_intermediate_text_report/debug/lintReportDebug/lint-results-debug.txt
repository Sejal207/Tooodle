C:\Users\KHUSHI GOYAL\Downloads\Tooodle\app\build.gradle:12: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk 34
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application or sdk runs on a version of Android that is more
   recent than your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with,
   various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application
   continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the
   targetSdkVersion is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the
   UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html
   as well as follow this guide:

             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "CustomSplashScreen":
   Starting in Android 12 (API 31+), the application's Launch Screen is
   provided by the system and the application should not create its own,
   otherwise the user will see two splashscreens. Please check the
   SplashScreen class to check how the Splash Screen can be controlled and
   customized.

      ~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "AndroidGradlePluginVersion":
   This detector looks for usage of the Android Gradle Plugin where the
   version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older
   versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick
   with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more
   recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

C:\Users\KHUSHI GOYAL\Downloads\Tooodle\app\src\main\res\layout\activity_getting_started.xml:6: Warning: Possible overdraw: Root element paints background #5B3A1B with a theme that also paints a background (inferred theme is @style/Theme.Mad_toodle) [Overdraw]
    android:background="#5B3A1B">
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "Overdraw":
   If you set a background drawable on a root view, then you should use a
   custom theme where the theme background is null. Otherwise, the theme
   background will be painted first, only to have your custom background
   completely cover it; this is called "overdraw".

   NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated
   with which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it's currently
   doing that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can
   incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then
   wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.

   If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should
   consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using
   that theme instead of a root element background.

   Of course it's possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you
   want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better
   performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that
   resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead.

    <string name="login_screen">Login Screen</string>
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

C:\Users\KHUSHI GOYAL\Downloads\Tooodle\app\src\main\res\drawable\gettingstartedchar.jpg: Warning: Found bitmap drawable res/drawable/gettingstartedchar.jpg in densityless folder [IconLocation]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLocation":
   The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such
   as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to drawable-mdpi and
   consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in drawable-ldpi,
   drawable-hdpi and drawable-xhdpi. If the icon really is density independent
   (for example a solid color) you can place it in drawable-nodpi.

                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UseTomlInstead":
   If your project is using a libs.versions.toml file, you should place all
   Gradle dependencies in the TOML file. This lint check looks for version
   declarations outside of the TOML file and suggests moving them (and in the
   IDE, provides a quickfix to performing the operation automatically).

C:\Users\KHUSHI GOYAL\Downloads\Tooodle\app\src\main\res\layout\activity_home.xml:10: Warning: Hardcoded string "Welcome to Home!", should use @string resource [HardcodedText]
        android:text="Welcome to Home!"
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "HardcodedText":
   Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several
   reasons:

   * When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or
   portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when
   making changes)

   * The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding
   new translations for existing string resources.

   There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a
   resource lookup.

C:\Users\KHUSHI GOYAL\Downloads\Tooodle\app\src\main\res\layout\activity_google_signin.xml:39: Warning: Consider replacing android:drawableLeft with android:drawableStart="@drawable/ic_google" to better support right-to-left layouts [RtlHardcoded]
            android:drawableLeft="@drawable/ic_google"
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "RtlHardcoded":
   Using Gravity#LEFT and Gravity#RIGHT can lead to problems when a layout is
   rendered in locales where text flows from right to left. Use Gravity#START
   and Gravity#END instead. Similarly, in XML gravity and layout_gravity
   attributes, use start rather than left.

   For XML attributes such as paddingLeft and layout_marginLeft, use
   paddingStart and layout_marginStart. NOTE: If your minSdkVersion is less
   than 17, you should add both the older left/right attributes as well as the
   new start/end attributes. On older platforms, where RTL is not supported
   and the start/end attributes are unknown and therefore ignored, you need
   the older left/right attributes. There is a separate lint check which
   catches that type of error.

   (Note: For Gravity#LEFT and Gravity#START, you can use these constants even
   when targeting older platforms, because the start bitmask is a superset of
   the left bitmask. Therefore, you can use gravity="start" rather than
   gravity="left|start".)
